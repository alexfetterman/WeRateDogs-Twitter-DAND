# Wrangle and Analyze Data
Project completed as part of Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)

## Overview
Data from the [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) Twitter account is gathered using various techniques, 
assessed for cleanliness/tidiness, then cleaned and finally analyzed. Please note that the project was developed
in a private repository because of the use of Twitter user tokens, with commits made regularly and with consistency,
but for privacy reasons this version is made public, in which only select commits are shown (after the keys/tokens 
were hidden).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, random, matplotlib, requests, os, tweepy, json, time collections, itertools
- Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

## Findings
TBD
