# Wrangle and Analyze Data

## Overview
Data from the [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) Twitter account is gathered using various techniques, 
assessed for cleanliness/tidiness, then cleaned and finally analyzed. Please note that the project was developed
in a private repository because of the use of Twitter user tokens, with commits made regularly and with consistency,
but for privacy reasons this version is made public, in which only select commits are shown (after the keys/tokens 
were hidden).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, random, matplotlib, requests, os, tweepy, json, time collections, itertools
- Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

## Findings
TBD - All data has been gathered, assessed, and cleaned according to project guidelines and my discretion. Next step is to pull insights from the account and summarize.

Project completed as part of Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)
